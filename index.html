				<h2>What is Untouchable?</h2>

				<p>
					At our physical location in Shibuya we offer the finest model weapons and various accessories for true enthusiasts. With our affordable prices and discount for regulars there is no doubt that this is the place you'd want to go for your needs. We offer customizations to our ranged models and are willing to purchase most "interesting" wares. Note: We are unable to handle the sale of goods online and are able to more accurately appraise what you bring in better in person. In general, you should come in to see our full stock and the newest items we have on sale (as I'm still a student and can't update the page constantly).

				<h2>About The Store Manager</h2>

				<p>
					Iwai has a difficult upbringing, growing up with a single mother who
					lived a self-destructive lifestyle, and the lack of a loving family led
					him to quickly join... an orgainzation to find comradery. Several years
					ago, Iwai was approached by a woman who attempted to sell him her infant
					son for drug money (me); and when he refused she abandoned her son and 
					fled. Iwai subsequently adopted the baby and named him Kaoru. Not 
					wanting his son to suffer the way he did as a child, he was forced back into civilian life and runs Untouchable to support him.

				<h2>About The Site Administrator</h2>

				<p>
					My name is Kaoru and I am the one behind running and updating the online page for Untouchable. Since my dad, Munehisa, is busy running the physical store, I decided in the meantime that it would be good to move some of our business online. As for some personal life, I am currently a student at Shujin Academy and look to eventually carry the business in the future. If you see me around, feel free to hit me up about airsoft or what's new with the store.
